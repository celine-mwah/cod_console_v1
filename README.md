A external tool to adjust filmic values in several Call of Duty titles.
This tool is meant to be used with WAWMVM to record game cinematics.

Features include:
- A demo browser to easily select and start your demos 
- A film tweaks tab
- A environment presets tab with various presets
- A sequence feature that lets you transition from one preset to another
- A sun tab with an animation/system flicker
- A keyframing system that lets you create you your own sequences and lets you keyframe every property
- A config system
- A hotkey/bind system that let's you set actions to customizable binds

  Some features may cause crashes/visual bugs and force you to restart the game, please do not spam them

  The keyframing/animation system is not compatible with cl_avidemo or streams -- You have to record with timescale and a recording software of your choosing.
